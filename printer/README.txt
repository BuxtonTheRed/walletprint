Notes
-----
There are many source files included here which are not used by this application.

Not every place in the BAU source which might need to be fixed up to make it fully multi-coin ready has been changed.

I'm not ashamed of my code, but you have been warned that there is a fair amount of chaos going on in here!

(tip: start with Forms\frmPrototype.cs - that's currently the main form for the completed program)
